# 18 Feishu Connector Guide

Use this guide when you want DeepScientist to continue a quest through Feishu / Lark.

The current open-source runtime prefers the built-in long-connection path:

- no public event callback is required for the recommended setup
- the main credentials are `app_id` and `app_secret`
- multiple Feishu app connections can be configured as separate `profiles`
- direct messages can auto-bind to the latest active quest when enabled

## 1. What Feishu support includes

DeepScientist currently supports Feishu through:

- `FeishuLongConnectionService` for inbound long-connection delivery
- `GenericRelayChannel` for bindings, inbox/outbox, targets, and runtime status
- `FeishuConnectorBridge` for direct outbound sends

This means Feishu already fits the same quest-binding model as the other connector surfaces.

## 2. Recommended setup path

1. Open the Feishu / Lark developer platform.
2. Create an app.
3. Save `app_id` and `app_secret`.
4. Open `Settings > Connectors > Feishu`.
5. Enable Feishu.
6. Keep `transport: long_connection`.
7. Fill `app_id` and `app_secret`.
8. Save the connector.
9. Send one real message to the bot.
10. Return to DeepScientist and confirm that the target conversation has been discovered.

For multiple Feishu apps, add one enabled entry per app under `profiles`. Each
profile needs a unique `profile_id`, unique `app_id`, and its own `app_secret`
or `app_secret_env`.

## 2.1 Settings page at a glance

Route:

- [Settings > Connectors > Feishu](/settings/connector/feishu)

Use this page to:

- keep `transport: long_connection`
- fill `app_id` and `app_secret`
- inspect runtime status, discovered targets, and connector health after the first message

## 3. Important config fields

Main fields:

- `enabled`
- `transport`
- `bot_name`
- `app_id`
- `app_secret`
- `api_base_url`
- `command_prefix`
- `dm_policy`
- `allow_from`
- `group_policy`
- `group_allow_from`
- `groups`
- `require_mention_in_groups`
- `auto_bind_dm_to_active_quest`
- `profiles`

For the full field reference, see [01 Settings Reference](./01_SETTINGS_REFERENCE.md).

## 4. Binding model

Feishu conversations are normalized into quest-aware connector ids like:

- `feishu:direct:<chat_id>`
- `feishu:group:<chat_id>`

DeepScientist binds quests to those normalized conversation ids, not to transient callback payloads.

Important rules:

- one quest keeps local access plus at most one external connector target
- direct messages can auto-follow the latest active quest when auto-bind is enabled
- bindings can be changed later from the project settings page

If several quests are running, read [34 Multitask Entry Guide](./34_MULTITASK_ORCHESTRATION_GUIDE.md) first. Do not put every task into one chat entry.

## 5. Group behavior

By default:

- direct messages are allowed
- group behavior depends on `group_policy`
- if `require_mention_in_groups` is `true`, the bot only reacts when explicitly mentioned or when a command is used

This is the recommended default for larger shared workspaces.

## 6. Outbound delivery

Feishu outbound delivery currently focuses on text-first quest updates:

- progress
- milestone summaries
- binding notices
- structured quest replies

The current bridge delivers through the Feishu Open Platform messaging API.

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Feishu does not appear in Settings

Feishu may be hidden by the system connector gate. Confirm that:

- `config.connectors.system_enabled.feishu` is `true`

### Validation says credentials are missing

Check that:

- `app_id` is filled
- `app_secret` is filled
- or `app_secret_env` points at a real environment variable

### No discovered targets appear

Check that:

- the app credentials are correct
- the bot has received at least one real inbound message
- `transport` is still `long_connection`

### Group messages do not trigger the bot

Check:

- `group_policy`
- `groups`
- `group_allow_from`
- `require_mention_in_groups`

### The quest does not continue from Feishu

Check that:

- the conversation is bound to the intended quest
- or `auto_bind_dm_to_active_quest` is enabled for direct-message pairing
