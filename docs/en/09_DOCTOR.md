# 09 `ds doctor`: Repair Startup and Environment Problems

Use `ds doctor` when DeepScientist does not start cleanly after installation.

If DeepScientist already launches and you can reach the web UI, do not start from raw logs first. Start from the visual operator path:

1. open [30 Settings Control Center Guide](./30_SETTINGS_CONTROL_CENTER_GUIDE.md)
2. check `Summary`, `Runtime`, `Diagnostics`, and `Errors`
3. only then fall back to `ds doctor` or raw config edits if the visual surface is not enough

The `Diagnostics` page is the operator-facing surface that pairs best with `ds doctor`:

## Recommended flow

1. Install DeepScientist:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @researai/deepscientist
   ```

2. Make sure Codex itself is working first:

   Default OpenAI path:

   ```bash
   codex login
   ```

   Provider-backed profile path:

   ```bash
   codex --profile m27
   ```

   If `codex` is missing, repair it explicitly with:

   ```bash
   npm install -g @openai/codex
   ```

3. Try to start DeepScientist:

   ```bash
   ds
   ```

4. If startup fails or looks unhealthy, run:

   ```bash
   ds doctor
   ```

5. Read the checks from top to bottom and fix the failed items first.

6. Run `ds doctor` again until all checks are healthy, then run `ds`.

## What `ds doctor` checks

- local Python runtime health
- whether `~/DeepScientist` exists and is writable
- whether `uv` is available to manage the local Python runtime
- whether `git` is installed and configured
- whether required config files are valid
- whether the enabled/default runner configuration is internally consistent
- whether the Codex CLI can be found and passes a startup probe
- whether a recent quest runtime failure already points to a known provider / protocol / retry problem
- whether an optional local `pdflatex` runtime is available for paper PDF compilation
- whether the web and TUI bundles exist
- whether the configured web port is free or already running the correct daemon

Important Codex distinction: `codex login` only proves that the Codex CLI completed its
authentication flow. The `ds doctor` runner check is stricter: it sends a real
non-interactive `codex exec` request and expects a `HELLO` response. A machine can
therefore show "Successfully logged in" from `codex login` while `ds doctor`
still fails because the model is unavailable, the provider key is missing from
the DeepScientist process environment, the proxy is not inherited, or the Codex
profile/config directory differs from the one you tested manually.

`ds doctor` now tries to render failed checks in a more operational form:

- `Problem`: what failed
- `Why`: why DeepScientist believes it failed
- `Fix`: the concrete next steps to try
- `Evidence`: the quest/run/request clues that matched the diagnosis

For failed runner probes, the report also includes the useful low-level evidence
when available: exit code, probe command, selected profile/model, stdout excerpt,
and stderr excerpt. Use those fields before retrying blindly.

## Common fixes

### Codex is missing

DeepScientist prefers the `codex` already available on your machine and only uses the bundled dependency as fallback. If neither is present, run the package install again so the bundled Codex dependency is present:

```bash
npm install -g @researai/deepscientist
```

If `codex` is still unavailable afterward, install it explicitly:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
```

### Codex is installed but not logged in

Run:

```bash
codex login
```

If you prefer the interactive first-run flow, run `codex` and finish the setup there.

Finish login once, then rerun `ds doctor`.

If `codex login` says success but `ds doctor` still fails, run the same kind of
non-interactive smoke test that DeepScientist uses:

```bash
printf 'Reply with exactly HELLO.' | codex --search exec --json --cd /tmp --skip-git-repo-check -
```

If that command fails, fix Codex, the selected model, the profile, the provider
key, or the proxy first. If that command succeeds but `ds doctor` fails, compare:

- `which codex`
- `CODEX_HOME`
- `HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, and `NO_PROXY`
- `~/DeepScientist/config/runners.yaml`
- any `runners.codex.env` values needed by provider-backed profiles

### Codex profile works in the terminal, but DeepScientist still fails

Run DeepScientist with the same profile explicitly:

```bash
ds doctor --codex-profile m27
ds --codex-profile m27
```

If your working Codex CLI is not the one on `PATH`, point DeepScientist at it explicitly:

```bash
ds doctor --codex /absolute/path/to/codex --codex-profile m27
ds --codex /absolute/path/to/codex --codex-profile m27
```

`m27` is the MiniMax profile name used consistently in this repo. MiniMax's own page currently uses `m21`, but the profile name is only a local alias; if you created a different name, use that same name in both commands.

Also check:

- the same shell still exports the provider API key
- if `codex --profile <name>` works but `ds doctor` or `ds docker` still reports a missing provider environment variable, also put that key in `~/DeepScientist/config/runners.yaml` under `runners.codex.env`
- the profile points at the provider's Coding Plan endpoint, not the generic API endpoint
- if you are using Qwen through Alibaba Bailian, use the Bailian Coding Plan endpoint only; the generic Bailian or DashScope Qwen API is not supported here
- `~/DeepScientist/config/runners.yaml` uses `model: inherit` if the provider expects the model to come from the profile itself

MiniMax-specific note:

- if MiniMax fails on the current `@openai/codex` latest, install `npm install -g @openai/codex@0.57.0`
- when DeepScientist detects a MiniMax profile on startup and the installed Codex CLI is not `0.57.0`, it now offers to reinstall `0.57.0` automatically in interactive terminal launches
- create a MiniMax `Coding Plan Key` first
- for plain terminal `codex --profile <name>` checks, clear `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_BASE_URL` in the current shell before exporting `MINIMAX_API_KEY`
- use `https://api.minimaxi.com/v1`
- the `codex-MiniMax-*` model names shown on MiniMax's current Codex CLI page did not pass reliably through Codex CLI in local testing with the provided key
- the locally verified DeepScientist model names are `MiniMax-M2.7` and `MiniMax-M2.5`
- for `m25`, use `MiniMax-M2.5`, not `codex-MiniMax-M2.5`
- DeepScientist can auto-adapt MiniMax's profile-only `model_provider` / `model` config shape during probe and runtime
- DeepScientist also strips conflicting `OPENAI_*` auth variables automatically for providers that set `requires_openai_auth = false`
- if you also want plain terminal `codex --profile <name>` to work directly, put `model_provider = "minimax"` and the matching top-level model such as `MiniMax-M2.7` or `MiniMax-M2.5` in `~/.codex/config.toml`
- DeepScientist automatically downgrades `xhigh` to `high` when it detects a Codex CLI older than `0.63.0`
- if the provider returns `tool call result does not follow tool call (2013)`, treat it as a request-ordering/protocol error rather than a transient network failure
- if the provider returns malformed tool-call argument errors such as `invalid function arguments json string` or `failed to parse tool call arguments`, fix the tool-call serialization path before retrying again

### The configured Codex model is unavailable

DeepScientist blocks startup until Codex passes a real startup hello probe. In the current release, that probe first uses the runner model configured in:

```text
~/DeepScientist/config/runners.yaml
```

The default is `gpt-5.4`. If your Codex account or CLI config cannot access that model, DeepScientist now retries with the current Codex default model and persists `model: inherit` for future runs. If you still want a specific model, edit the runner config manually and rerun:

```bash
ds doctor
```

For provider-backed Codex profiles, `model: inherit` is usually the right default.

### `uv` is missing

Normally `ds` will bootstrap a local `uv` automatically. If that bootstrap fails, install it manually:

```bash
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

On Windows PowerShell (still strongly recommend WSL2 for regular DeepScientist use):

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
```

### Local paper PDF compilation is unavailable

DeepScientist can compile papers without a full TeX Live install if you add a lightweight TinyTeX runtime:

```bash
ds latex install-runtime
```

If you prefer a system package instead, install a distribution that provides `pdflatex` and `bibtex`.

### Port `20999` is busy

If it is your managed daemon:

```bash
ds --stop
```

Then run `ds` again.

If `ds doctor` says the port is already serving another DeepScientist home, use
the home path printed in the error. For example:

```bash
ds --home /path/printed/by/doctor doctor
ds --home /path/printed/by/doctor --stop
```

This usually means you started DeepScientist once from one directory/home and are
now running `ds doctor` against another home. Either use the already running home
or change this home to a different port.

If another service already uses the port, change `ui.port` in:

```text
~/DeepScientist/config/config.yaml
```

Or start on another port directly:

```bash
ds --port 21000
```

### Python `3.10` or older is active

DeepScientist still prefers the active conda environment when it already satisfies Python `>=3.11`.

If your current conda environment is too old, either activate a newer one:

```bash
conda activate ds311
python3 --version
which python3
ds
```

Or create a suitable one:

```bash
conda create -n ds311 python=3.11 -y
conda activate ds311
ds
```

If you do nothing, `ds` can still bootstrap a managed `uv` + Python runtime automatically under the DeepScientist home.

### Git user identity is missing

Run:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
```

### Runner switching and enablement

Current releases support `codex`, `claude`, `kimi`, and `opencode`.

If a non-default runner was enabled by mistake, check:

```text
~/DeepScientist/config/config.yaml
~/DeepScientist/config/runners.yaml
```

Then confirm:

- `default_runner` points at the runner you actually want
- the selected runner has `enabled: true`
- disabled runners stay disabled if you are not using them
- `ds doctor` passes for the enabled runner before you switch quests over

## Notes

- `ds docker` is kept as a compatibility alias, but the official command is `ds doctor`.
- The default browser URL stays in the plain local form, for example `http://127.0.0.1:20999`.
- When local browser auth is enabled, DeepScientist shows a password modal before loading the workspace.
- You can view the current password in the launch terminal or through `ds --status`.
- By default the password modal is disabled; use `ds --auth true` when you want the local browser password gate for one launch.
