# 26 Citation And Attribution

This page explains how we hope people cite and acknowledge DeepScientist.

This document is intentionally gentle:

- it is a request for fair academic attribution
- it is not an extra restriction added to the software license
- it is not legal advice

## Short version

If DeepScientist materially helps a paper, report, benchmark write-up, or public research artifact, please:

1. cite the DeepScientist paper
2. disclose meaningful AI assistance honestly
3. avoid presenting AI-generated or AI-simulated results as purely human or purely real if that would mislead readers

If you only used DeepScientist in a minor operational way, such as opening files, launching a shell, or checking a repository layout, citation is usually not necessary.

## When we strongly encourage citation

Citation is strongly encouraged when DeepScientist materially contributes to work such as:

- research planning or task decomposition
- baseline restoration or experiment orchestration
- literature triage or structured paper analysis
- result analysis, synthesis, or writing support
- figure, draft, or rebuttal preparation

The practical rule is simple:

- if DeepScientist changed the substance, speed, or shape of the research output in a meaningful way, please cite it

## When citation is usually not necessary

Citation is usually unnecessary when DeepScientist was used only as:

- a local launcher
- a terminal convenience layer
- a generic code or file browser
- a one-off operational helper without material research contribution

## Preferred citation

Paper link:

BibTeX:

```bibtex

booktitle={The Fourteenth International Conference on Learning Representations},

}
```

## Suggested acknowledgment text

If DeepScientist materially assisted the project, a short acknowledgment like the following is usually enough:

```text
We used DeepScientist to assist parts of the research workflow, including selected planning, implementation, experiment orchestration, analysis, and/or writing support. Final judgments, claims, and reported real experimental results remain the responsibility of the human authors.
```

You can shorten or adapt this wording to match venue norms.

## Optional FermiLink attribution

DeepScientist's science-evidence workflow was informed by FermiLink's
scientific simulation and package-knowledge design. If your project materially
uses FermiLink itself, cite it directly in addition to DeepScientist.

## AI assistance disclosure

We strongly encourage clear disclosure when DeepScientist contributed to:

- writing
- coding
- experiment setup
- result interpretation
- figure generation
- literature review

The disclosure does not need to overstate use.
It should simply help readers understand where meaningful AI assistance existed.

## Not a license condition

This citation guidance does not change the repository software license.

In particular:

- it is not a new license condition
- it does not terminate your software rights if you forget to cite
- it is a community and academic attribution request, not a software-usage gate
