Unlike one-shot **AI Scientist** or **autoresearch-style systems**, DeepScientist is a **local-first autonomous research studio** that keeps the full loop moving on your machine, from **baselines** and **experiment rounds** to **paper-ready outputs**, with a **10-minute setup**. Powered by **Findings Memory**, **Bayesian optimization**, and the **Research Map**, it keeps turning each new result into the next starting point and goes deep through broader exploration and, when needed, **thousands of experiment validations**.

If you want the technical deep dive behind DeepScientist, watch the [Video](https://event.baai.ac.cn/activities/962).

## Still Spending Your Time On Research Grunt Work?

What drains researchers is often not the lack of ideas. It is the endless cycle of low-leverage work:

- new papers keep coming, but only a small fraction turns into an actionable next-step research plan
- baseline repos fail on environment, dependency, data, and script issues before real work even starts
- experiment results get scattered across terminals, scripts, notes, and chats, making later review painful
- writing, figures, and analysis live in separate tools, so turning them into a coherent paper takes far too long

This is the problem DeepScientist is built to solve:

> turn fragmented, repetitive, easy-to-lose research work into a local AI workspace that can keep moving, keep accumulating, and keep getting stronger over time

## DeepScientist Is Not Just Another "Research Chatbot"

It is not a tool that summarizes papers, throws you a few ideas, and leaves the dirty work to you.

It is much closer to a real long-running AI research partner:

| What common AI tools often look like | What DeepScientist does instead |
|---|---|
| Great at chatting, but context disappears quickly | Turns tasks, files, branches, artifacts, and memory into durable state |
| Good at suggesting ideas, but weak at sustained execution | Pushes papers, baselines, experiments, and writing inside one workspace |
| Strong automation, but feels like a black box | Lets you inspect the process through the web workspace, Canvas, files, and terminal |
| Hard to take over once it goes off track | Lets you pause, take over, edit plans, change code, and continue at any time |
| Each run ends when the run ends | Preserves failed paths, winning paths, and reproduction lessons for the next round |

## About

> DeepScientist is not a one-shot agent demo. It is a system built for long-horizon research work.

## What Can It Actually Help You Get Done?

### 1. Start a real project from a paper or a research question

- feed it a core paper, a GitHub repository, or a natural-language research objective
- it turns those inputs into an executable quest instead of a chat that loses state after a few turns

### 2. Reproduce baselines and keep the reproduction reusable

- restore repositories, prepare environments, handle dependencies, and track the critical failures
- preserve what broke, what got fixed, and which steps are trustworthy for future rounds

### 3. Run experiments continuously instead of stopping after one pass

- propose the next hypothesis from existing results
- branch, ablate, compare, and record conclusions
- keep failed routes as assets instead of deleting them

### 4. Turn results into materials you can actually ship

- organize findings, conclusions, and analysis
- produce figures, reports, and paper drafts
- support local PDF and LaTeX compilation workflows

### 5. Follow the same research effort from multiple surfaces

- the web workspace in your browser
- the TUI workflow on a remote server
- external connector surfaces for collaboration and progress updates

The current docs already cover these collaboration channels:

- [Weixin](docs/en/10_WEIXIN_CONNECTOR_GUIDE.md)
- [QQ](docs/en/03_QQ_CONNECTOR_GUIDE.md)
- [Telegram](docs/en/16_TELEGRAM_CONNECTOR_GUIDE.md)
- [WhatsApp](docs/en/17_WHATSAPP_CONNECTOR_GUIDE.md)
- [Feishu](docs/en/18_FEISHU_CONNECTOR_GUIDE.md)
- [Lingzhu / Rokid](docs/en/04_LINGZHU_CONNECTOR_GUIDE.md)

## Why Is It Easier To Keep Using?

What retains users is not a flashy demo. It is a system that becomes more useful the longer you work with it.

DeepScientist tends to stick for four reasons:

### Local-first by default

- code, experiments, drafts, and project state stay on your own machine or server by default
- this is especially valuable for unpublished ideas, sensitive experiment history, and longer-running research loops

### One repo per quest

- every quest is a real Git repository
- branches, worktrees, files, and artifacts naturally express research structure

### The process is not a black box

- it does not only give you an output
- you can inspect what it read, what it changed, what it kept, and what it plans to do next

### Human collaboration is built in

- DeepScientist can move autonomously
- you can also step in, edit, redirect, and hand control back whenever you want

## Why Try It Now?

Because this is not just a concept. It is a real system with public docs, a public paper, and a public install path.

- `2026/03/24`: DeepScientist officially released `v1.5`
- `2026/02/01`: the paper went live on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/forum?id=cZFgsLq8Gs) for `ICLR 2026`
- npm install path is already available: [`@researai/deepscientist`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@researai/deepscientist)
- both Chinese and English docs are available, along with Web, TUI, and connector entry points

### Projects surface after long-running work

![DeepScientist projects surface](assets/readme/projects-surface.png)

## Who Will Love DeepScientist Most?

- graduate students and engineers who want to reproduce papers and push beyond existing baselines
- labs or research teams running long experiment loops, ablations, and structured result analysis
- people who want code, experiments, notes, and writing to live in one workspace
- users who do not want to hand unpublished ideas and intermediate results directly to a pure cloud workflow
- people who want to run work on servers while following progress from web, TUI, or messaging surfaces

## The Core Philosophy Behind DeepScientist

We believe a system that is actually suitable for research should at least satisfy these principles:

- one quest, one repository, instead of letting everything dissolve after a short conversation
- branches and worktrees should express research routes naturally instead of being forced into chat history
- failed paths should be preserved, summarized, and reused instead of overwritten
- human researchers should always retain takeover power instead of being locked outside the loop
- the research process should be reviewable, inspectable, and auditable instead of relying on "the model says it did it"

If that sounds like the way you want to work, DeepScientist is worth trying now.

## 🚀 Get Started In 30 Seconds

If you want to try it right now, choose one of these two paths: run the npm commands yourself, or ask the coding tool you already use to install it for you.

Platform note: DeepScientist fully supports Linux and macOS. Native Windows support is currently experimental (strongly recommend WSL2).

### Option 1: Manual Install With npm

Use this path when you already know which runner you want and prefer to control the install, login, and launch commands yourself.

DeepScientist ships four built-in runners:

- `codex`: use this when `codex` already works directly on your machine
- `claude`: use this when `claude` already works directly on your machine
- `kimi`: use this when `kimi` already works directly on your machine
- `opencode`: use this when `opencode` already works directly on your machine

If one of these CLIs already works for you, DeepScientist can usually meet you there instead of asking you to rebuild your whole setup first.

Think of the startup choice like this: bring one runner that already works, and DeepScientist gives you a persistent local research workspace around it.

If you just want the safest recommendation, start with Codex first.

🎯 Recommended first run: `codex`

```bash
npm install -g @researai/deepscientist
codex login
ds --here
```

If Claude Code already works directly in your shell, use this lane:

```bash
npm install -g @researai/deepscientist
claude --version
ds doctor --runner claude
ds --here --runner claude
```

If Kimi Code already works directly in your shell, use this lane:

```bash
npm install -g @researai/deepscientist
kimi --version
ds doctor --runner kimi
ds --here --runner kimi
```

If OpenCode already works directly in your shell, use this lane:

```bash
npm install -g @researai/deepscientist
opencode --version
ds doctor --runner opencode
ds --here --runner opencode
```

If you want to connect Gemini or Ollama, first use the runner-specific docs instead of guessing DeepScientist fields:

- Gemini: prefer [OpenCode Setup](docs/en/25_OPENCODE_PROVIDER_SETUP.md)
- Ollama: choose Codex, Claude Code, or OpenCode with [Local Model Backends Guide](docs/en/21_LOCAL_MODEL_BACKENDS_GUIDE.md)

To stop the managed local daemon and all currently running agents:

```bash
ds --stop
```

🛠 Prefer installing from a Git checkout instead of npm? Use the repo path directly:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ResearAI/DeepScientist.git
cd DeepScientist
bash install.sh
ds
```

### Option 2: Let A Coding Tool Install It

Use this path when you already work inside Codex, Claude Code, OpenCode, Cursor, or another coding agent. There are only two steps:

1. Launch the coding tool in a directory where you are comfortable installing DeepScientist.
2. Copy and send this prompt:

```text
Please install and launch DeepScientist on this machine. The official repo is https://github.com/ResearAI/DeepScientist and the docs start at https://github.com/ResearAI/DeepScientist/blob/main/docs/en/README.md . First inspect Node.js/npm, git, Python, OS, and shell environment. If global npm install is appropriate, run npm install -g @researai/deepscientist and verify ds --help. If source install is safer, git clone https://github.com/ResearAI/DeepScientist.git, cd DeepScientist, read the README, and run bash install.sh. After installation, confirm at least one runner works locally, such as codex, claude, opencode, or kimi; authenticate that CLI first, then run ds doctor --runner <name>, start with ds --here, and report the local URL plus the exact config docs I should read next.
```

If you plan to edit the UI or TUI from source, also install the workspace dependencies:

```bash
npm --prefix src/ui install
npm --prefix src/tui install
```

If you prefer the interactive first-run flow, run this once first:

```bash
codex
```

If `codex` still appears to be missing after installing DeepScientist, take the explicit repair path instead of assuming the bundled dependency was linked correctly:

```bash
npm install -g @openai/codex
which codex
codex login
```

If `which codex` still prints nothing after that, fix the npm global bin path first, then retry `codex login` and `ds doctor`.

Important runner note:

- DeepScientist can fall back to npm-bundled helper copies for `codex`, `claude`, and `opencode` when they are installed with the package. Kimi Code is treated as an external CLI unless a compatible local `kimi` helper is present.
- Runner authentication and provider configuration still belong to the underlying CLI. Make `codex`, `claude`, `kimi`, or `opencode` work once in your shell, then run `ds doctor --runner <name>`.
- You can also start DeepScientist first with the default runner and switch/configure Claude Code, Kimi Code, or OpenCode later from the web workspace settings.

After startup, the default local address is:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:20999
```

Local browser auth is now optional and disabled by default. If you want a per-launch local access password, start with:

```bash
ds --auth true
```

Then you only need to do three things:

1. click `Start Research`
2. fill in the research goal, baseline links, paper links, or local paths
3. let DeepScientist start a real research project that can keep evolving locally

If this is your first run, prefer an isolated environment, a non-root user, and a local machine. For the full details, see:

## Roadmap

We are building DeepScientist as a long-term local-first research operating system.

The next major upgrades focus on four directions:

### 1. Deeper Research Loops

- AI Scientist Benchmark support for more realistic evaluation and comparison
- smoother automatic baseline upload, download, and reuse
- stronger experiment replay, comparison, and paper-facing outputs

### 2. Stronger Long-Horizon Memory

- stronger Memory and Findings Memory mechanisms
- better cross-run and cross-quest reuse
- less repeated failure and less rediscovery cost over long projects

### 3. Richer Multimodal And Collaborative Workflows

- VideoAnything-style multimodal research capabilities
- better local-model, connector, and copilot/autonomous collaboration flows
- a more efficient and more reliable DeepScientist system across local, collaborative, and long-horizon research settings

### 4. Stronger Security And Safer Deployment

- safer local-first and server-side deployment defaults
- stronger auth, permission, and connector-surface protection
- less fabrication, lower hallucination, and more verification-grounded outputs
- better auditability for long-running autonomous research workflows

If this direction is interesting to you, please give the project a `Watch` and a `Star`:
